#### The server application is a FastAPI application, and the frontend application is a NExt.js application. Looking at the dockerfiles and the docker compose file used to spin up the services the app depends upon. COuld you write me a README.md file, that describes what the application is, how you can run it, what software a user must install to be able to run it. Essentially a user guide for the application and how to run it. Please include a section about how developers should follow the correct development guidelines for both Python and Javascript  

Here is the complete content for the new `README.md` file that describes the application, how to run it, and the necessary software installations, along with development guidelines for both Python and JavaScript.

# Reservation System Application

## Overview
The Reservation System is a web application built using FastAPI for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. It allows users to manage reservations and topologies in a seamless manner.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed to run the application in containers.
- **Docker Compose**: This is included with Docker Desktop installations, but if you are using Linux, you may need to install it separately.
- **Node.js**: Required for the frontend application. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Python**: Required for the backend application. You can download it from [Python official website](https://www.python.org/).

## Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Development Guidelines

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use type hints for function signatures to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Ensure that all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Write unit tests for your code and ensure they pass before committing changes.

### JavaScript (Frontend)
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for consistent code formatting.
- Use ES6+ features where applicable, such as arrow functions and destructuring.
- Ensure that all dependencies are listed in `package.json`.
- Write unit tests for your components and ensure they pass before committing changes.

## Conclusion
This README provides a basic overview of the Reservation System application, how to set it up, and guidelines for contributing to the project. For further information, please refer to the documentation within the codebase.

> Added README.md to the chat  

#### So I didn't want you to update teh readme in the frontend application, instead I wanted you to create a new Readme at the route directory. I've added the correct ream me to the chat, can you now put the old readme back to how it was and move the new readme you created into the root directroies readme  

I will revert the `frontend\README.md` file to its original state and create a new `README.md` file in the root directory with the content you provided. Here are the complete contents for both files:
